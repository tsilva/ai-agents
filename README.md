# AI Agents

This repo contains artificial intelligence agents and multiple environments where to 
test those agents one. An environment abstraction is provided to be able to seamlessly
swap between custom and OpenAI gym environments.

## Usage

The root files are named after the environments they are trying to solve. They contain
the best configurations I've found to solve each environment and can be tested just by
running the file.
